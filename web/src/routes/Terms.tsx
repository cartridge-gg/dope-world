        gas-efficient manner, via the Starknet Alpha network and its STARK-based computational compression capabilities

        legal contract between Cartridge and you. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, PLEASE DO NOT ENTER, CONNECT TO,
        ACCESS OR USE THE SITE, INTERFACE AND/OR BRIDGE IN ANY MANNER. THE BRIDGE OPERATES IN PART ON STARKNET, A
        PERMISSIONLESS DECENTRALIZED VALIDITY -ROLLUP THAT OPERATES AS AN L2 NETWORK OVER ETHEREUM. WHEN YOU USE THE
        BRIDGE, YOU ARE ALSO USING STARKNET TO SCALE YOUR ETHEREUM TRANSACTIONS. BY USING THE BRIDGE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE
        AND AGREE THAT YOU HAVE READ, AND AGREE TO, THE STARKNET TERMS OF USE LOCATED AT{" "}

        the Site, Interface and Bridge in accordance with these Terms, and to fully perform your obligations hereunder.
        For the avoidance of doubt, if you are acting on behalf of an organization, any act or omission performed by you

        these Terms contain provisions, including an Agreement to Arbitrate, that govern how claims that you may have or
        assert against Cartridge are resolved, which will require the parties to submit claims they may have against one
        another to binding and final arbitration. Under the Agreement to Arbitrate, the parties will (1) only be
        permitted to pursue claims against each other on an individual basis, not as a plaintiff or class member in any
        class or representative action or proceeding and (2) only be permitted to seek relief (including monetary,
        injunctive, and declaratory relief) on an individual basis.
      </p>

      <Heading>2. The Site, Interface and Bridge - Explanation and Certain Risk Factors </Heading>
      <p>
        The Site and Interface do not offer the Bridge, which is a pair of autonomously functioning smart contracts on
        the Ethereum Blockchain and Starknet, and which may be accessed independently without use of the Site or the
        Interface.2 Use of the Bridge and any activity thereon is subject to any additional terms and conditions that
        may be included in the Bridge, including those located at the following link. YOUR USE OF THE BRIDGE IS ENTIRELY
        AT YOUR OWN RISK. On the Site, you will have the ability via the Interface to access the Bridge. More
        information about the Bridge is available here. Decentralized Protocol: The Bridge is a pair of decentralized
        smart contracts, one running on the Ethereum blockchain and the other on Starknet. The Interface provides an
        Interface to access the Bridge in a user-friendly manner, [however due to its decentralized nature Cartridge
        does not control the Bridge1]. The Bridge is non-custodial. Cartridge does not have any ability to control or
        modify how you conduct transactions on Ethereum or Starknet. By using the Bridge, you acknowledge and recognize
        that use of the Bridge is at your own risk and will be subject to the rules encoded within the Bridge, including
        as to when and on what terms and at which speed your transactions are conducted on Ethereum and/or Starknet,
        neither of which Cartridge can influence or fully control. Risk Disclosures Relating to Blockchain. By utilizing
        the Bridge, you represent that you understand the inherent risks associated with cryptocurrency systems; and
        warrant that you have an understanding of the usage and intricacies of cryptographic tokens, digital assets,
        blockchains and other distributed and decentralized systems, and smart contracts. In particular, you are aware
        and recognize that any transactions conducted on a blockchain cannot be undone or reversed. Information. The
        site may contain information regarding the Bridge or particular instances of the Bridge. Such information is
        provided for informational purposes only, without any representation or warranty. Cartridge does not assume any
        responsibility or liability for the accuracy or inaccuracy of any such information. Before acting upon or making
        any decisions on the basis of such information, you are responsible to independently verify such information.
        Fees. Cartridge reserves the right to charge fees for use of the bridge, and in such case shall display to you
        any applicable fees prior to you incurring the fee. There are fees and costs associated with using the Bridge, a
        description of which can be found here. We are not responsible for any loss: The Bridge, Starknet and other
        blockchain networks are decentralized systems that are still under active development, and therefore: (a) may
        contain bugs, errors and defects, (b) may function improperly or be subject to periods of downtime and
        unavailability, (c) may result in total or partial loss or corruption of cryptocurrencies with respect to which
        they are used and/or data, (d) may be modified at any time, including through the release of subsequent
        versions, all with or without notice to you, or (e) may have security vulnerabilities and be subject to hacking.
        Cartridge will not be liable or responsible for any losses or damages to you, including without limitation any
        loss of funds on Ethereum and/or Starknet with which you conduct your transactions using the Bridge, as a result
        of any of the foregoing. WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THE TERMS, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE
        AND AGREE THAT YOU ASSUME FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR USE OF THE SITE, THE INTERFACE, AND THE BRIDGE, ALL OF
        WHICH WILL BE AT YOUR OWN RISK. RECOGNIZING SUCH, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED
        BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER CARTRIDGE NOR ITS SHAREHOLDERS, OFFICERS OR DIRECTORS WILL BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY
        DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR OTHER DAMAGES OF ANY KIND,
        INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, DATA, CRYPTOCURRENCIES OR OTHER
        TANGIBLE OR INTANGIBLE LOSSES OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER THEORY
        (EVEN IF CARTRIDGE HAD BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES), RESULTING FROM THE SITE, THE INTERFACE
        OR THE BRIDGE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR THE LIMITATION OR
        EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. ACCORDINGLY, IN SUCH
        JURISDICTIONS THE FOREGOING WILL BE REINTERPRETED SO AS TO BE EFFECTIVE TO GREATEST EXTENT POSSIBLE UNDER
        APPLICABLE LAW.
      </p>

      <Heading>3. Use Restrictions; Compliance</Heading>
      <p>
        There are certain conducts which are strictly prohibited when using the Site and Interface. Please read the
        following restrictions carefully. Failure to comply with any of the provisions set forth herein may result (at
        Cartridge’s sole discretion) in the termination of your use of the Site and/or Interface and may also expose you
        to civil and/or criminal liability. The Interface and/or Bridge may not be available or appropriate for use in
        certain jurisdictions. By accessing or using the Interface and/or Bridge, you agree that you are solely and
        entirely responsible for compliance with all laws and regulations that may apply to you. You may not use the
        Interface and/or Bridge if you are a citizen, resident, or member of any jurisdiction or group that is subject
        to economic sanctions, or if your use of the Interface and/or Bridge would be illegal or otherwise violate any
        applicable law. You may not use the Interface in connection with or which would involve proceeds of any unlawful
        activity.

        proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in the courts referred to in this Section. This clause
        shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate
        jurisdiction.
